## Overview  
SafeNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network designed for compatability with edge devices to predict safe landing zones for drones. Using a grid-based binary classification approach, it analyzes image sections to determine areas free from hazards like water, buildings, and trees.

**Why is this significant?** 
With an increased use of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) in **disaster relief and warefare,** operators may encounter disconnections caused by weather, low battery, obstacles, or **GPS Jammers** and in these scenarios a protocal to land safely by just taking an image of the ground below. 

This project was my way of introducing myself to computer vision and by no means do I think this model is deployable, but I do believe that similar approach/models could solve real world problems like **aid/package delivery** or even **analyze/fight wild-fires** using the models predictions of flat areas which could help identify safe zones for landing, optimize waterbomber flight paths, or assist in assessing areas for safe operations during emergencies.

## Key Features  
- **Edge-Capable:** Model inferences based on entire image allowing for real time predictions on edge devices suitable for quadcopter drones. While I was unable to test my model on any industry edge devices, sub 1-second predictions ran on my Intel i7 CPU. [This article](https://medium.com/@samsterckval/google-coral-edge-tpu-vs-nvidia-jetson-nano-a-quick-deep-dive-into-edgeai-performance-bc7860b8d87a) found that the NVIDIA Jetson Nano performs similar if not better than the i7â€“4870HQ on machine learning tasks because of its specialized GPU architecture, which is optimized for parallel processing in machine learning tasks.

- **Grid-Based Labeling:** Divides large images into 4800 (60x80) binary labels corresponding to pixel safety (0 = "safe", 1 = "unsafe") 
- **Lightweight Model Architecture:** YOLO inspired, the model predicts the entire image rather than image kernels allowing for faster predictions compared to the alternative sliding window approach.

- **Class Weights to Prioritize Safety:** By weighting safe predictions more than unsafe predictions the model is trained to priotize recall and limit false-safe predictions. This feature is essential for deployment as losing a drone could be costly, so the model must have very high confidence for safe predictions. 

## Dataset: FloodNet

The **FloodNet dataset** is a high-resolution UAV imagery dataset designed for post-disaster damage assessments. The images were captured after Hurricane Harvey which caused major flooding in suburban areas producing an abundance of obstacles that can be utilized during training simulating disaster relief scenarios.

### Key Features of FloodNet:
- **10 Classes** ('Background':0, 'Building-flooded':1, 'Building-non-flooded':2, 'Road-flooded':3, 'Road-non-flooded':4, 'Water':5, 'Tree':6, 'Vehicle':7, 'Pool':8, 'Grass':9)
- **Total Images:** 2343 (Train: 1445, Val: 450, Test: 448)
- **High-Resolution UAV Imagery:** Provides detailed 3000x4000px images taken at a height of 200 feet with a high 1.5cm spacial resolution.  
- **Semantic Segmentation:** Pixel-wise labeling allows masks that can be used for regional classification. 


### How My Project Uses FloodNet:
Firstly, using the original segmentation labels from the masks I needed to seperate the labels into "Safe" or "Unsafe" for classification. 

Of the 10 labels I concluded that...

Flat areas like **grass and roads/parking lots** could be considered **safe** for drone landing. I originally labeled road as unsafe but later revised as most disaster scenarios that would require drone deployment would be due to road unaccessibility, meaning that there would be no moving cars to avoid. 

I deemed any **background, buildings, flooded-roads, water, trees, pools, or vehicles** as unsafe which is self-explanatory. 

Then using the masks I was able to create 60 row x 80 colomn binary labels for each image. This was excuted by sliding a 50x50px across the masks 


### Accessing the Dataset:
The FloodNet dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the [official repository](https://github.com/BinaLab/FloodNet-Supervised_v1.0).
